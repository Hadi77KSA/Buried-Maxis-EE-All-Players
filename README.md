# Buried-Maxis-EE-All-Players

Wisp step, bell step, and sharpshooter are changed.

-Wisp cant disappear during wisp step on 2p or less as long as the player that summoned it doesn't go too far from it.

-Bell step doesn't have a timer on 2p or less and will only reset if you fail.

-Sharpshooter relies on how many players are in the match. 20 targets for solo, 39 for 2p, and all targets for 3p and 4p and more.
